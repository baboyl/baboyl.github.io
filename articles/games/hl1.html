			<center><h3>Half Life</h3></center>
		<p>Half Life was and still is an impressive game, there were things I never even noticed such as cockroach ai, and smell which honestly for a game made in 1998 is pretty amazing.</p>
		<p>I really liked the combat and how every encounter with an enemy requires some thinking instead of going in guns blazing, well you can play the game like that but you will die a lot. And I mean a lot.</p>

		<p>The plot is well made in my opinion. You play as a scientist named Gordon Freeman who causes an experiment to go horribly wrong that opens a portal which leads to another dimension named Xen. You have to escape the facility </p>
