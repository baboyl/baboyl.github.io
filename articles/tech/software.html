        <h3>Software I use</h3>
        <p>I really like FOSS (Free Open Source Software) because it respects my privacy and freedom. If you haven't used FOSS then you should really check it out sometime, they are mostly on sites like <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com">Gitlab</a>. </p> 

        <h5>Operating System</h5>
        <p>The OS I run on my computer is <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, a free lightweight and bleeding edge Linux distrubution. I liked the idea of having a distro which I can make into my own without dealing with a complex install process like with Gentoo.</p>

        <h5>Web Browser</h5>
        <p>My main web browser is <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">Ungoogled-Chromium</a>, it's just Chromium without Google's tracking and spying.</p>

        <h5>File Manager</h5>
        <p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcmanfm/files/">Pcmanfm</a> is a perfect file manager, it's very light and simple and it looks good. Another nice thing is that is has thumbnail previews which is pretty handy when you store files with random names.</p>

        <h5>WM/DE</h5>
        <p>My window manager is <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, it is a very light and customizable window manager, the tags are very useful for keeping your windows organized. </p>

        <h5>Media Player</h5>
        <p><a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a>, a very minimal and lightweight media player with plenty of shortcuts.</p>

        <h5>Text Editor</h5>
        <p>For basic editing I use <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, it is very light, runs in a terminal and the keybinds are awesome.</p>

        <h5>Terminal Emulator & Shell</h5>
        <p>The terminal emulator I prefer is <a href="https://git.suckless.org/st/">st</a> (Simple terminal), it is very lightweight and easy to configure if you know C. My default shell is ZSH, it is very good if you would like to have some customizability while also having a bash like experience.</p>

        <h5>Video/Image editor</h5>
        <p>For video editing I use <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/">Kdenlive</a>, it's pretty good for editing but it did take me a while to get used to how it works. For image editing I use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, it's very simple to use and can edit lots of image types.</p>
